    "Telling the future is the exciting part of data mining.  Everyone wants to build the best model that can be the most accurate prediction of future results or have the best explanation for why the past occurred the way it has.  But in order to have a valuable model, it is important to understand the data, determine the shape, understand the predictors and the target variables (if any).  Understanding the scale of these values and their relationship to each other can save hours of testing different modelling techniques and parameter tuning.\n",

    "The next cell is one that will appear in some configuration as the first in nearly every notebook.  It imports the key libraries we are going to use in our analysis and model building.  In the first case, we will depend on pandas and numpy for our data manipulation and we'll leverage matplotlib as our graphical library.  We'll also use the seaborn library to show off a few plots and visuals that are not quite as readily accessible with the matplotlib library."

    "Let's take a look at some basic data manipulation with pandas and understand how to get some data to work with.  In all of our examples, we'll use a pretty standard text format called (CSV) or comma-separated-values files.  This format is readable by nearly every statistical software package and by humans.  The first row is typically the name of the columns and each line of the file is a row of data with the values separated by commas.  The pandas library supports many different ways to load up a dataframe, which we will use as the primary mechanism for manipulating data in these notebooks."
