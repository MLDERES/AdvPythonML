    "# Prediction and Estimation\n",

    "## Evaluating Predictive Performance\n",
    "Evaluating performance of predictive or estimation models which use continuous targets uses a different technique than quantifying error rates.  Predictions are not simply correct or incorrect, but we can decide how close we were in our prediction or how far away.  A few techniques to determine performance of continuous target predictions include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Mean Error - the average difference between the predicted and expected target\n",
    "  * Valuable if the direction of the prediction is important (too high or too low) though it can be misleading since too-high and too-low can cancel each other out.\n",
    "* MAE - Mean absolute error - the average difference between the predicted and expected target not accounting for sign \n",
    "(+/-)\n",
    "  * takes the too high or too low issue out of play\n",
    "* MPE - Mean percentage error - average percentage difference between predicted and expected target\n",
    "* MAPE - Mean absolute percentage error - average percentage difference between predicted and expected target (using absolute values rather than positive or negative error)\n",
    "* MSE - Mean square error - average of the square of the error of each prediction\n",
    "  * penalizes significant outliers and removes units so it is a relative metric only\n",
    "* RMSE - Root mean square error - square root of the average of the square of the error of each prediction (provides relative units)\n",
    "  * still significantly penalizes bigger errors but also provides units of the base metric\n"

    "## Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "Linear regression models are a great model to explain a linear relationship between predictors and target variables (assuming a linear relationship exists).  They are easy to explain and have a built-in metric to identify the importance of each predictor.  Also, we can use this information to include just enough of the variables to accurately describe the target possibly reducing the complexity\n",

    "With linear regression we are attempting to describe a target variable in terms of a set of coefficients in a linear equation such as:\n",

    "where $\\beta$ represents coefficients and $X$ are the predictive factors (independent variables) and $\\epsilon$ is _noise_ or _unexplainable_ part.  Data is used to estimate the coefficients and quantify the noise."
